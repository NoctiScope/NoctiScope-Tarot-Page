# Card Drawing Demo

A small experimental Python script for random tarot card drawing, combining divination-inspired workflows with coding.

## What it does
- Draws a user-defined number of cards
- Allows repeated draws (with replacement)
- Supports upright and reversed orientations
- Outputs results in a simple, readable text format

## Why
- Reduce friction: physical card drawing can be tiring. A script enables quick iterations and lightweight logging.
- Repeats as emphasis: repetition can be treated as a signal (e.g., emphasis), which differs from many traditional no-replacement draws.

## Status
Experimental. Treat it as a personal reflection/communication tool, focusing on your own context.

## Notes
- This repo is intentionally minimal—an interdisciplinary exploration rather than a polished software package.
- Text-only output (no visuals).
- Written with the standard Rider–Waite–Smith (RWS) tarot as a reference. You may use your own physical deck while reading the text output.
- If you are unsure how to interpret the results, you can paste the output into an AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Gemini, DeepSeek) for brainstorming—use your judgment.

### Guidelines
- Avoid asking the same question too many times in a short period.
- Use this tool for self-reflection rather than probing other people’s privacy.
